## ‚ùì How to run

- Install the bot's dependencies (pnpm, npm or whatever you use).
- Modify the `Bot.ts`files  in `./src/components/` for your bot's configuration.
- Either make a `.env` file based off the config in `.env-example` or configure the `config.ts` in `./src/components/` for your bot.
- Run the `build` script.
- Run the `bundle.js` output file in the `dist` folder or the `start` script.

## ‚ùì Extra information

As of @discordjs/voice version 0.18.0, you must only install one of the following packages yourself if your system doesn't support AES-256-GCM (verify by running require `('node:crypto').getCiphers().includes('aes-256-gcm')`)

- sodium-native: ^3.3.0
- sodium: ^3.0.2
- @stablelib/xchacha20poly1305: ^2.0.0
- @noble/ciphers: ^1.0.0
- libsodium-wrappers: ^0.7.9

You will also need to install node-gypm and the requirements that they tell you for a C++ compiler for your operating system as `zlib-sync` uses C++.
